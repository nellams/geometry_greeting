# geometry_greeting

Mrs. Fisher (your sixth grade geometry teacher, aww!) has asked you to return now that you're a super smart developer and write a Ruby program that automatically greets students when they arrive at class.

Part 1

Write a method greet that takes a person's name as a single, required argument. It should output a greeting for the supplied name.

Part 2

Modify your method so that it uses a random greeting among the following options below.

Hi [name]!
Yo [name]!
Hey [name]!
Howdy [name]!
Sample output:


Part 3

Modify your method so that it takes an optional, second argument, the user's language. If the second argument is not specified, the method should default to English.

The method should support:

English: "Hi [name]!"
Spanish: "Hola [name]!"
Italian: "Ciao [name]!"
French: "Bonjour [name]!"
